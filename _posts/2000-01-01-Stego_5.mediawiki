First dump the file into a hex dump file, hd:
<pre>
 hd stego5.bmp | cut -f 2-20  -d " " | tr "\n" " " | sed 's/   / /g' | sed 's/  / /g' > hd
</pre>

edit the file and take the 00003a2e off at the end... <br>

There are streams of pixels, with 3 hex bytes representing the RBG. Sometimes they are a little off:

<pre>
3e 3f 3f 4e 4f 4f 42 43 42 3b 3b 0a
 0  1  1  0  1  1  0  1  0  1  1  0
</pre>

The full bit stream reveals the password to be:

<pre>
syn-ack-rst
</pre>

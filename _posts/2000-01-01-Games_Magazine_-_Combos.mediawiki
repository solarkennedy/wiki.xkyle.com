Combos is a [[Games Magazine]] puzzle where one must find Disney animated films that have a series of letters in the title. An example is "erpa = Peter Pan" because the letters e,r,p,a appear in Peter Pan in that order. Sounds like a perfect job for Grep!


== Code ==
Here is the code:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
for LETTER in `echo $1 | sed 's/./&\n/g'`
do
COMMAND="$COMMAND ?$LETTER"
done
exec egrep -e "$COMMAND" list
</pre>

== Explaination ==
The code outputs an grep command like this:
 grep -e ' ?n ?d ?w' list
The class " ?" matches a possible blank space, then we have a "n", then any number of characters, and so on. The above shell script just makes it easy to create those reg-ex's.
